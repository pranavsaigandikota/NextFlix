  description:
    "Built a movie discovery app using React Native and Expo where users can browse trending movies, view detailed information, watch trailers, and manage personalized watchlists. Each user can sign in and save or unsave movies to their own secure list. Used Appwrite as the backend for authentication and database storage. Through this project, I learned how to integrate third-party APIs, work with Appwrite for user management and data storage, and build scalable, responsive UIs with Expo Router and NativeWind.",
